# Some homework revision

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
```

Kelly visualisation:
```{r}
read_tsv("./Swedish-Kelly_M3_CEFR.tsv") %>%
  arrange(desc(`Raw freq`)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Raw freq`)) %>%
  filter(WPM != 1000000) %>%
  mutate(Rank=1:length(ID)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log(Rank), y=log(`Raw freq`))) + geom_line()
```

Another version of the same thing, less "idiomatic" tidyverse (old-fashioned way)
```{r}
kelly <- read_tsv("Swedish-Kelly_M3_CEFR.tsv")
kelly <- filter(kelly, !(is.na(`Raw freq`) | WPM == 1000000))
kelly$rank <- 1:nrow(kelly)
kelly %>% ggplot(aes(rank, `Raw freq`)) + geom_line()
```

Now plot this again taking the log values of rank and frequency
```{r}
read_tsv("Swedish-Kelly_M3_CEFR.tsv") %>% 
  filter(!(is.na(`Raw freq`) | WPM == 1000000)) %>% 
  mutate(rank=1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log10(rank), log10(`Raw freq`))) + geom_line()
```

What's that "blip"? How can we fix it?
```{r}
# Sort it by Raw freq, descending
kelly %>% arrange(desc(`Raw freq`))
```
And then redo everything with the fix incorporated

```{r}
read_tsv("Swedish-Kelly_M3_CEFR.tsv") %>%
  arrange(desc(`Raw freq`)) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(`Raw freq`) | WPM == 1000000)) %>% 
  mutate(rank=1:nrow(.)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(log10(rank), log10(`Raw freq`))) + geom_line()
```


# Wide and long data

Wide data:

![](./wide-data-example.png)

Long data:

```{r}
head(babynames)
```

- Long data is good for visual analysis: every row is an observation
- Humans generally prefer to *read* wide data
- There are times when wide data is important
- `gather` changes wide to long
- `spread` changes long to wide

![Wide vs. long](./wide-long.png)

Wide format
```{r}
data <- tibble(row=c("A", "B"), x=1:2, y=3:4, z=5:6)
data
```

Long format
```{r}
data %>% gather("column", "value", c("x", "y", "z"))
```


# Loading data directly from excel format

(this is relatively new, I didn't know about it earlier)

These excel files are from the Swedish [Central Statistics Agency, SCB](http://www.scb.se/hitta-statistik/statistik-efter-amne/befolkning/amnesovergripande-statistik/namnstatistik/)

Look at the spreadsheet and the read_excel documentation
- named sheets (we need to select a particular sheet)
- blank lines at beginning (`skip` them)
- column types (can you see what they are?)

```{r}
library(readxl)
girls <- read_excel("be0001namntab11_2017.xlsx", sheet = "Flickor", skip = 4)
boys <- read_excel("be0001namntab12_2017.xlsx", sheet = "Pojkar", skip = 4)
head(girls)
```

Check the column titles:
```{r}
names(girls)
names(boys)
```

We want to check that the column names of `girls` and `boys` are the same. You can just do one of the following:
```{r}
names(girls) == names(boys) # expect a long vector of TRUEs
```
You can also do:
```{r}
all(names(girls) == names(boys)) # returns TRUE if all the values in the vector are TRUE
```
But a more elegant way to do it is to incorporate *tests*. The `testthat` package introduces a bunch of `expect_` functions that make your script crash (infomatively!) if the expectation is violated.
```{r}
library(testthat)
expect_equal(names(girls), names(boys))
```
The test does *nothing* if it passes. You can incorporate tests into your scripts to make sure nothing unexpected is happening after e.g. you update data.
```{r}
a <- 1:5
b <- 1:4
expect_equal(a, b)
```

Assuming things work as expected you can add a column to specify male or female name, and then bind your tables together into a single table.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
girls <- girls %>% mutate(sex = "F")
boys <- boys %>% mutate(sex = "M")
data <- rbind(girls, boys)
```
Now take a look:
```{r}
head(data)
```

# Convert swedish babynames from wide to long

Back to Swedish baby names. In order to work with this we need to convert it from wide to long format: there should be a single `year` column with year column headers as variables. 

# Gathering

**This is very important!**

* gather(.data, new_column_with_collected_headers, new_column_for_values_of_cells, ...all_the_columns_to_gather...)

The following function all the year columns into one column with year (the old column header), and one column with the value of the cell.

We use `as.character` because this refers to the column headers, which count as text. If we used numerals what would it mean?

```{r}
long.data <- gather(data, year, count, as.character(1998:2017)) 
head(long.data)
```

Note that the year and count columns are shown as <chr> (character) rather than <dbl> (a numeric type). You won't be able to graph these until you fix them.
The count data is character rather than numeric; fix this with mutate

```{r}
long.data <- gather(data, year, count, as.character(1998:2017)) %>% 
  mutate(year=as.numeric(year), count=as.numeric(count))
head(long.data)
```

Now ggplot recognises the numbers as numeric rather than as character strings it can plot them:

```{r}
long.data %>% filter(Namn=="Michael") %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=count)) + geom_line()
```

```{r}
long.data %>% filter(Namn=="Linnéa") %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=count)) + geom_line()
```

```{r}
long.data %>% filter(Namn=="Linnéa" | Namn=="Anna" | Namn=="Robert") %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=count, linetype=Namn)) + geom_line()
```

# Fixing ("coercing") character types

Look again at `head(data)`. All the numbers have been imported at characters. Can you guess why?

This is a problem:
```{r}
values <- c("1", "7", "8?", "-", "not applicable")
values
# You can't do mathematical operations with the character representations of numbers
# values + 1
```
Use `as.numeric` to coerce the type of an object to numeric. Anything that can't be coerced turns into NA (not available)
```{r}
numeric.values <- as.numeric(values)
numeric.values # note NA for "not available"; the warning message
numeric.values + 1
```

You can do this the other way around too, with `as.character` (like we did in the gather example above)

There are other `as.XXX` functions for every other type of object, but you're less likely to need these.

### summarise() and group_by()

Reduces all the rows to *one* row
```{r}
babynames %>% summarise(mean_n=mean(n), median_n=median(n))
```

`group_by` reduces all the rows to a smaller number of rows, according to the `group_by` term/s; summarise then works on each *group* (`group_by` doesn't make much sense without a `summarise` or similar after it)

```{r}
# group_by sex
babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael") %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(first_seen=min(year), last_seen=max(year))
```


```{r}
our_names = c("Anna", "Bror-Magnus", "Lena", "Linnéa", "Maja", "Marc", "Mervi", "Rima", "Robert", "Rune", "Michael")
babynames %>% filter(name %in% our_names) %>% group_by(name) %>% summarise(total=sum(n))
```

Exercise: what are the mean and median number of male and female names in the data?

You can group by multiple things at once to get every combination
```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Michael", "Magnus", "Anna", "Maja")) %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>% # every combination of name and sex
  summarise(total=sum(n)) 
```

## Spread example

Here's a chance to use `spread`. Let's say we want to look at the *ratio* of male to female version of each of these names:

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Michael", "Magnus", "Anna", "Maja")) %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>% # every combination of name and sex
  summarise(total=sum(n)) %>% 
  spread(sex, total)
```

We could convert this in a manliness rating for names:

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Michael", "Magnus", "Anna", "Maja")) %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>% # every combination of name and sex
  summarise(total=sum(n)) %>% 
  spread(sex, total) %>% 
  mutate(manliness=M/(M+F))
```
Oops, have to change the NAs to 0, because anything + NA is NA

```{r}
babynames %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Michael", "Magnus", "Anna", "Maja")) %>% 
  group_by(name, sex) %>% # every combination of name and sex
  summarise(count=sum(n)) %>%  
  spread(sex, count) -> data
# writing an intermediate variable is a clunky way to do it, but I'm not too proud
data$F[is.na(data$F)] <- 0
data$M[is.na(data$M)] <- 0
data %>% 
  mutate(manliness=M/(M+F)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(manliness))
```
## an aside on indexing

```{r}
values <- c(3,6,17, NA, NA, 5)
values
```
```{r}
is.na(values)
```
Indexes in square brackets
```{r}
values[2]
values[2:4]
```
Assign to indexed vectors
```{r}
values[1:2] <- -99
values
```
```{r}
values[is.na(values)] <- 0
values
```
Other kinds of logic also possible
```{r}
values[values < 0] <- NA
values
```

### Histogram

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(year==2000) %>% ggplot(aes(x=log10(n))) + geom_histogram()
```



## stringr 

Simple character manipulations, see documentation: https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/stringr.html

- Look at the cheatsheet, from https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/
- The **Data transformation** and **R Markdown** cheatsheets are good too 

```{r}
library(stringr) # you might need to load this separately (or it might be part of tidyverse)
# str_sub(x, start, stop)
our_names = c("Anna", "Bror-Magnus", "Lena", "Linnéa", "Maja", "Marc", "Mervi", "Rima", "Robert", "Rune")
str_sub(our_names, 1, 2)
# positive and negative indices
str_sub(our_names, 1, 1)
str_sub(our_names, -3, -1) %>% str_to_upper()
```

- We can do lots of interesting things with this by adding the output of this to a new column using `mutate`

Exercises:

Try one of:
  - add a column called `final_a` with TRUE or FALSE values for whether the name has a final *a*
  - add a column for `first_letter`
- explore this variable (e.g. interaction with sex, change over time)

# Trends in a-final names

```{r}
babynames %>% mutate(final_a=str_sub(name, start=-1)=="a")
```
We could e.g. graph this, with sex as a variable:
```{r}
babynames %>% 
  mutate(final_a=str_sub(name, start=-1)=="a") %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, final_a) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=count, colour=sex, linetype=final_a)) + geom_line()
```
But this really only makes sense as proportions:
```{r}
babynames %>% 
  mutate(final_a=str_sub(name, start=-1)=="a") %>% 
  group_by(year, sex, final_a) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  spread(final_a, count) %>% 
  rename(no_final_a=`FALSE`, final_a=`TRUE`) %>% 
  mutate(prop=final_a/(final_a+no_final_a)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=prop, colour=sex)) + geom_line()
```

Some ideas for further exercises

- What's happened to "Leslie"? Plot the change in male and female Leslies over time
- Can you order names by what year they peak?
- Can you work out a way to find more names which have changed their typical gender over time?
- Has the proportion of vowel final names (consider girls and boys separately) changed over time?
- What is the male-female bias in initial letters?
- How many distinct names are used for boys and girls each year? What about a better measure (e.g. number of names/number of individuals)
