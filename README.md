Materials for the PhD course *Visualisation and Statistical Analysis* held in the Faculty of Languages, Uppsala University, Autumn Term 2018.

## Week 1 (2018-09-24)

- [Slides](01-introduction/01.introduction-slides.html) (from your browser, press key 'f' for fullscreen, 'w' for wide format)

For homework, 

- Revise the [notebook](01-introduction/01.introduction-notebook.Rmd) from the session, and finish up the final session (vectors). A good way to work is to read through and predict what will happen in each chunk before running it.
- Then do the [homework](01-introduction/01.introduction-homework.html) exercises. The main two parts are (i) working out how to install a package (a collection of special functions that work together), and (ii) writing functions to encapsulate a sequence of commands to carry out a particular.... function.
- Read [Wilson et al. 2017](01-introduction/Wilson_etAl_2017_Good_enough_practices.pdf) and prepare a question or comment.
