# Tidyverse vs. base R

- The read_csv is the tidyverse version of read.csv. 
- We're working in the tidyverse `library(tidyverse)` at the beginning of every script!

```{r}
# Base R

m <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3)
m # a matrix
```
```{r}
m[1,1] # a cell
```
```{r}
m[1,] # a vector
```

## Preliminaries

- Please install the `babynames` package. All loading this package does is give you one big tibble called `babynames` with some interesting sample data for us to play with
- To install the package use RStudio "Tools" -> "Install packages..."

It's good style to do all your library function calls at the beginning of your scripts, notebooks, etc. For example, tidyverse redefines `filter`, and you don't want `filter` to mean one thing for one half of your script and something else for the other. It also means that if you cut-and-paste something you know where to look for any libraries it might depend on.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames) 
```
- loading babynames gives you access to a huge tibble (table of text and numerical data) called `babynames`
- You can enter `help(babynames)` in the console to get a description of the data (SSA is the US Social Security Administration). Next week we'll look at Swedish names instead!

Long data: every observation is its own row. Next week we'll look at Swedish name data from Statistiska CentralbyrÃ¥n, which is in "wide" format (multiple observations per row)
```{r}
head(babynames)
```

## First steps with dplyr (part of tidyverse)

Dplyr aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data manipulation. These include:

    - filter() to select cases based on their values.
    - arrange() to reorder the cases.
    - select() and rename() to select variables based on their names.
    - mutate() and transmute() to add new variables that are functions of existing variables.

The dplyr verbs: filter, select:

Filtering rows:
```{r}
# the filter function is aware of the names of the columns in the table
filter(babynames, name=="Michael", sex=="F")
```
```{r}
filter(babynames, name=="Lena", year==2000)
```
Use | for "or"
```{r}
filter(babynames, name=="Rima" | name=="Maja", year > 1959, year < 1966)
```

- `filter(a, b)` is the same as the "and" relationship `filter(a & b)`; cf. "or" `filter(a | b)`

```{r}
filter(babynames, name=="Xavier" | name =="Anastasia")
```

Selecting columns:
```{r}
select(babynames, year, name, n)
```

## Piping %>%

`funct(a, b)` is the same as `a %>% funct(b)`

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Lena", year==2000)
```

This can simplify things:

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael") %>% filter(year <= 1900) %>% filter(sex=="F")
```

http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html

Functions are verbs, arguments are nouns

How to deal with multiple steps of an analysis

- save intermediate steps (clutters the namespace, lots of memory)

```{r}
michael0 <- filter(babynames, name=="Michael")
michael1 <- select(michael0, name, n, year)
```
- overwrite the original (hard to debug)
```{r}
michael <- filter(babynames, name=="Michael")
michael <- select(michael, name, n, year)
```
- nested functions (have to read in inside-out order, arguments are spread out)
```{r}
michael <- select(
  filter(babynames, name=="Michael"), 
  name, n, year
)
```

- the pipe syntax (the human way!)
```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael")
# SAME AS filter(babynames, name=="Michael")
```

- piped functions can be chained together: 
```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael") %>% select(year, sex, name) # %>% some_plot_function()

```
Works best 

- with one input, one output
- not too many steps (<10)
- Notice the return value of the pipe: `a %>% b` "sends" a to b, and then the statement returns something, which can be sent along to the next thing `a %>% b %>% c`
- The thing that you're piping in is the first, default argument of the function. Tidyverse functions mark this in the help files with a leading dot, e.g. `.data` in `help(filter)`
- Chaining pipes together

- **TODO** Class time to experiment

### Assigning piped data

The final results of pipes can be assigned to variables as normal of course
```{r}
michael <- babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael")
```

There's also a right arrow `->` version of the assignment operator `<-`
```{r}
x <- 4
# is the same as 
4 -> x
```
- This is convenient on the console sometimes, when you want to reuse something from your history and assign it to a variable
- It's generally discouraged otherwise
- But it does make nice logical sense with pipe-sequences

```{r}
#michael <- babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael")
babynames %>% filter(name=="Michael") -> michael
michael
```
```
data %>% a() %>% b() -> result
```
  Compare the "normal" way:
```
result <- data %>% a() %>% b()
```
### sorting columns with arrange

`desc` means descending

```{r}
# When was "Xavier" popular?
babynames %>% filter(name=="Xavier") %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

### Renaming columns
```{r}
# rename
michael %>% rename(popularity=prop)

# select with rename
michael %>% select(name, gender=sex)
```

### mutate() adds columns
```{r}
babynames %>% mutate(log_n=log10(n)) %>% select(year, sex, name, log_n)
```
```{r}
# Remember the syntax for making a vector 1 to 10:
1:10
# Use this to add a "rank" column
michael %>% mutate(rank=1:nrow(michael))

#NOTE more effecient, robust way to do this:
michael %>% mutate(rank=1:nrow(.))
# this is better because you could substitute the tabular data "michael" with another table with different length and it would still work
```

Dot "." stands for "the thing that you're piping in" (for cases when it's not the first argument)
```{r}
rnorm(100) %>% tibble(id=1:100, n=.)
```

cf. also `.data` in docs (see e.g. `help(filter)`)

## ggplot

- Calling the function `ggplot` starts assembling the graph; it has the default argument `data`, which you can pipe to the function
- the `aes()` ("aesthetic") function maps data onto graph attributes
- You build up the plot in layers using `+`
- geometic layers have names starting with `geom_`. These include `geom_point` (scatterplots), `geom_box` (boxplots), `geom_histogram` (histograms)`, and may others. There is a default set that it part of tidyverse, and then others can be added by calling libraries.
- There are lots more things you can change, but these three steps are the basic idea: take data, map to an aesthetic, and plot as a geometric layer

```{r}
# geom_point()
babynames %>% filter(name=="Maria", sex=="F") %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=prop)) + geom_point() + geom_line()
# geom_col()
# geom_line()
```
Numbers like 1.5e-05 are scientific notation, shorthand for "1.5 times 10 to the power of -5", which means 0.000015

To disable this, use the following at the start of your notebook:
```{r}
options(scipen=999) # disable scientific notation (i.e. 1000 == 1e04)
```

**Preview** (we will look at this next week): you can specify other elements of the plot aesthetic to be determined by values in your data. Let's just use colour for now:

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Leslie") %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=prop, colour=sex)) + geom_line()
```
```{r}
# babynames %>% filter(name=="Maria") %>% mutate(log_n=log10(n)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=log_n, colour=sex)) + geom_line()
babynames %>% filter(name=="Maria")  %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=log10(n), colour=sex)) + geom_line()
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name=="Maria")  %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=log10(n), colour=sex)) + geom_col()
```

# Some statistical distributions

## Normal distribution

Galton Board

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HpvBZnHOVI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In a normal distribution:
- 68.2% of values within one standard deviation
- 95.4% within two standard deviations
- 99.7% within 3
- 99.99% within 4

![Standard deviations](Standard_deviation_diagram.svg.png)

Normal distributions can be described by two parameters, mean and standard deviation. The `rnorm()` function generates vectors of random numbers accordingn to a normal distribution.

**TODO** Read the help for the `rnorm()` function. Generate some vectors of normally distributed random numbers given different means and standard deviations.

## Histogram

- rnorm(N, mean, sd)

Here's how you can visualise these:
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # should do this at the beginning
my.data <- tibble(values=rnorm(100, 10, 2.5))
my.data %>% ggplot(aes(x=values)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

A small sample will be jagged, but the larger the sample the smoother it gets:
```{r}
tibble(values=rnorm(10000, 10, 2.5)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=values)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=1)
```

## Uniform distribution
There are many kinds of distributions.

- runif(N, min, max)

In the *Uniform distribution* there is an equal chance of getting any value between the minimum and the maximum
```{r}
my.data <- tibble(values=runif(1000, min=5, max=9))
#qplot(values, data=my.data, geom="histogram", breaks=1:10)
my.data %>% ggplot(aes(x=values)) + geom_histogram(breaks=1:10)
```
